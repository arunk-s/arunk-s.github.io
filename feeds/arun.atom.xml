This post is next on that topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wanted to be a computers guy I felt like home on linux. Developement of linux world is &lt;a href="http://beta.slashdot.org/story/12053"&gt;heavily geared&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://redd.it/1ugvgh"&gt;towards developers&lt;/a&gt;. You will get state of the art compilers,tools and developing environments by default in linux distros. I had much less overhead to get some project working on linux than my other friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You should first try Linux in a totally risk free way as a Live CD or USB disk. Many sofisticated tools are available online that will help you in that. But if you are looking to install it the traditional way, backup your data and look over to some good partitioning and installing documentation and tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/partitioning"&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/partitioning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about the Open Source is communities. There exists communities for every Linux distro and the people there are very helpful. There are specially dedicated forums, irc channels for newcomers. If you got stuck just jump over there and shoot and be patient. Just know that the community people are very faithful and passionate about their projects so you should be careful and follow some ground rules. But don't be shy to ask questions no matter how silly it seems, they will help you on every step. I have wonderful experiences with communities and I am sure you will have too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As linux is open source, extensive documentation exists for every part of the linux operating system. So it will help you to understand how computer works from the ground up. Trust me, I have learnt more by experiencing linux rather than an introductory OS course. You will get to know about every part of OS, processes, daemons, libraries etc.
This is totally optional of course!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you love having choices then linux got you covered, there are lots and lots of linux distro to choose from (distrowatch.com). There is one for every usecase you can think of. But choices doesn't end over there you will have infinite customization options. As a linux distro composed of several parts you can any assemble your own favorites and run them. You will have lots of desktop environments, window managers, themes etc. I was a distro hopper and I jumped over a lot of options to finally settle. Even now I ocassionaly try out some of them distributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters I will suggest to use a popular Linux OS and then they can carve their own path by keep tweaking. You should look for top things to do after installing. They will help you to get a more complete system. There are communities which are dedicated just for linux desktop customization you can look over there for inspiration. You will be amazed for sure. Furthermore there are many tools that can add to your productivity. You will discover them sooner or later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a little inquisitive and curious person than I think you will like Linux. There are certain lacks in Linux that I should tell you about. If you happen to be a serious Gamer then it may hurt you that certain games don't come for linux. Much development has been going on now in this area as Steam now has its own Linux OS. Much more games will be coming the Linux way for sure. But still you want to check your favourite game has a linux port or not.  &lt;br /&gt;
Also the hardware support for wifi cards in linux is pretty infamous. Before installing a distro you should check with your wireless card if it is supported by the kernel version of the current OS. But don't worry people find a way to keep it working. As they say everything just works in Linux.&lt;br /&gt;
If you got a problem of overheating then maybe your graphic card is running wildly. You should find appropriate drivers for you card and look for some good discussions over the community forums for your problems. There exists several power control applications which will help you to enhance your laptop battery and keep it cool.&lt;br /&gt;
If you get further problems first google it and then jump over to the community forums.&lt;/p&gt;

Some of those who use it are tagged as a bearded nerd, weirdo etc.&lt;br /&gt;
So I decided to write this blog post describing my first experiences with Linux which might give the people wanting to try it an upperhand. By the way here by Linux I mean the whole distribution not just the kernel unless I specifically say so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is not scary it's just a little different the way it works and you will love it for that.   &lt;br /&gt;
Web is filled with a lot of details about &lt;a href="http://www.linux.org/threads/what-is-linux.4076/"&gt;what Linux&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"&gt;is&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.whylinuxisbetter.net/"&gt;why you&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5772574/getting-started-with-linux-why-install-linux"&gt;should&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/166709/"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.getgnulinux.org/en/linux/"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_operating_systems"&gt;what are the differences&lt;/a&gt; etc. A lot has been already written on &lt;a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/beginner-s-guide-to-linux-where-to-start-1066778"&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://lifehacker.com/5778882/getting-started-with-linux-the-complete-guide"&gt;to start with&lt;/a&gt; linux it by people more qualified and experienced than me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I won't be reinventing the wheel again but I will tell you about the things to care for so you can avoid the trenches that I fell for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="From XKCD" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cautionary.png" title="Caution" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I saw the first pc running linux way back in 2009 when I was in highschool. It was running ubuntu 9.04 which was gaining quite a rep at that time. It was the first time I saw an OS other than some variant of Windows. I fell in love with it that very moment.
I had a desktop with 2 gigs of RAM and an intel dual core processor. It ran the obvious OS at that time Windows Xp. I used to tweak it frequently with bootskins, theme packages and all. But it crashes ocassionaly as one thing doesn't play well with the others. Pendrives were quite a phenomenon back then. One thing lead to another and came the problem of viruses. The solution everyone suggested is a paid antivirus software and I am not likely to give money for that (or for most things nowadays!).&lt;br /&gt;
Also they require certain updates at regular interval that needs internet which was a luxury for me. So I jumped here and there to look for updates. It was quite cumbersome to do such things; scan pendrives everytime, update the antivirus, license errors and what not. My system often ran into frequent crashes and I had to format it everytime I get viruses despite of those antiviruses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="From XKCD" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/linux_user_at_best_buy.png" title="Hell yeah" /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe I wasn't good at keeping my system healthy at that time but that didn't matter. So I got the advice of installing linux. I saw some guy working on it, brushing off on command line. I was mesmerized by it..the shell, window decorations, style etc. 
So I gave it a try. No more regular scanning, freeing space, deleting old files, defragmenting. Much less RAM usage and more focus on running apps. Now I can work and so I never look back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you want to know beforehand is to learn some basic commands. Nowadays most distributions are pretty smart and you won't need to use any commands but learning them will not cause you any harm. Moreover when you will learn them I am sure you will try to use it one way or another. Don't worry they are not so tough and hard to remember, I find them very interesting and &lt;a href="http://www.tecmint.com/20-funny-commands-of-linux-or-linux-is-fun-in-terminal/"&gt;fun&lt;/a&gt;. You will be amazed at the power of commandline so use them carefully. They will give you more control over your OS and will improve your workflow. When I first installed linux I just knew few commands which I learnt while overlooking the guy that gave me my first copy of Ubuntu. Since that day I keep discovering more and more of them.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time for a pause now but I will continue this in the next post.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till then,
Happy Hacking!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="linux"></category><category term="tips"></category><category term="tech"></category></entry><entry><title>The first post</title><link href="http://arunk-s.github.io/first-post.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-07-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Arun</name></author><id>tag:arunk-s.github.io,2014-07-19:first-post.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I am writing for a blog of myself and this is a great feeling, not that I haven't written essays, articles, summaries and all that stuff in my high school, writing for yourself,to express yourself and that can be read by anyone in the world is a totally different thing. I've been planning to blog ever since I started reading more stuff online than my regular studies (I don't remember when). But the time passes by and I just hung onto other things and my blog didn't happen for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a while back, I went into our college's open source meet and there I've made an attempt to made an static blog for the club. That blog was live in two hours without much fuss and that felt brilliant, just write a markdown and your post is ready. That felt like something that I could hung on to. So I decided to use some static site generator and make my own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But again, deciding to have a blog and making that happen took some time until my awaited long holidays happened.
So I started searching the static site generators for one that is suitable for me as there are so many great options out there.
I chose pelican for no good reason, it's just that I've touched more python than ruby and I don't want to be ignorant of what's going under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here it is, my first post on my own blog. &lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for reading this far, I am looking forward to having a great journey ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
Peace Folks!&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="just-a-thought"></category><category term="random"></category></entry></feed>
